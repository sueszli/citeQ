\section{Introduction}
The predominant and widely recognized scientometric indicator is the number 
of citations a paper garners. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that 
papers can be cited for diverse reasons. A citation may stem from a paper 
serving as the foundational work for current research, acting as a competitor 
in the field, or being subject to critique. 

The purpose of this paper is to study the citation purposes and its affects
on other scientometric indicators. We aim to answer the following research 
questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[RQ1] Do the citation purposes affect the total number of
    citations a paper or a researcher receives? (i.e. is there a karma effect?)
    \item[RQ2] How does the distribution of citation purposes change over time?
    \item[RQ3] Is there any difference in the distribution of citation purposes
    between same institution researchers and different institution researchers? 
    \item[RQ4] How does the distribution of citation purposes change over the
    duration of a researcher's career?
\end{enumerate}

To answer these questions, we collected the publication and citation data of
the University of Waterloo Computer Science faculty members. We then used
the large language model (LLM) llama2 \cite{touvron2023llama} to classify the citation 
purposes of each paper. We then analyzed this data to answer the research questions.

\section{Related Work}
Our work is related to a large body of research on citation analysis. Abu-Jbara et. al. \cite{abu2013purpose} provides a good starting point for citation purpose analysis. They propose 6 classes of citation purposes: criticizing, comparison, use, substantiating, basis, and neutral. We use these classes as the basis for our analysis.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Collection}
We used the Semantic Scholar (SS) API to collect the publication and citation data of all current (as of this writing) members of the University of Waterloo Computer Science faculty members. SS provides an API endpoint to retrieve the context of a citation. We used this endpoint to retrieve the citation context of each citation
made by a faculty member or to a faculty member. In total we collected data about 96 faculty members, 9,438 papers, and 697,609 citations. We formed an SQLite database, with the scheme shown in Figure \ref{fig:citeq-scheme}, to facilitate flexible querying of the data.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{citeq-scheme.png}
    \caption{CiteQ database scheme}
    \label{fig:citeq-scheme}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Citation Purpose Classification}
We experimented with a number of LLMs including chatGPT-3.5 \cite{brown2020language}, chatGPT-4.5 \cite{openai2023gpt4}, mistral \cite{jiang2023mistral}, and llama2 \cite{touvron2023llama}. Although chatGPT models performed slightly better in terms of accuracy, we decided to use llama2 with 7 billion parameters due to its low cost. We used 5 RTX4090 GPUs for 10 hours to classify the citation purposes of all 697,609 citations.

We used the following citation purpose classes: criticizing, comparison, use, substantiating, basis, and neutral. The Figure \ref{figure:prompt-template} shows the prompt template we used.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}
We hand labeled 100 citations to evaluate the accuracy of the classification.
The results are shown in Table \ref{table:evaluation}. We achieved an accuracy of 0.82. The accuracy of the classification is not as high as we would like. However, we believe that it is sufficient for our purposes.

\begin{lstlisting}

The following is a set of citation purpose categories, each category name is followed by a description of the category and an example of a sentence that belongs to this category.

Name: Criticizing
Description: Criticism can be positive or negative. A citing sentence is classified as "criticizing" when it mentions the weakness/strengths of the cited approach, negatively/positively criticizes the cited approach, negatively/positively evaluates the cited source.
Example: Chiang (2005) introduced a constituent feature to reward phrases that match a syntactic tree but did not yield significant improvement.

Name: Comparison
Description: A citing sentence is classified as "comparison" when it compares or contrasts the work in the cited paper to the author's work. It overlaps with the first category when the citing sentence says one approach is not as good as the other approach. In this case we use the first category.
Example: Our approach permits an alternative to minimum error-rate training (MERT; Och, 2003);

Name: Use
Description: A citing sentence is classified as "use" when the citing paper uses the method, idea or tool of the cited paper.
Example: We perform the MERT training (Och, 2003) to tune the optimal feature weights on the development set.

Name: Substantiating
Description: A citing sentence is classified as "substantiating" when the results, claims of the citing work substantiate, verify the cited paper and support each other.
Example: It was found to produce automated scores, which strongly correlate with human judgements about translation fluency (Papineni et al. , 2002).

Name: Basis
Description: A citing sentence is classified as "basis" when the author uses the cited work as starting point or motivation and extends on the cited work.
Example: Our model is derived from the hidden-markov model for word alignment (Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2000).

Name: Neutral (Other)
Description: A citing sentence is classified as "neutral" when it is a neutral description of the cited work or if it doesn't come under any of the above categories.
Example: The solutions of these problems depend heavily on the quality of the word alignment (Och and Ney, 2000).

Classify the following in text citation into one of these categories. Only use a single category for each citation. Respond with only a single word, the name of the category.
