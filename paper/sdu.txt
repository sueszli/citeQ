About Workshop:

Scientific documents such as research papers, patents, books, or technical 
reports are some of the most valuable resources of human knowledge. At the 
AAAI-24 Workshop on Scientific Document Understanding (SDU@AAAI [3]-24), we 
aim to gather insights into the recent advances and remaining challenges in 
scientific document understanding. Researchers from related fields are 
invited to submit papers on the recent advances, resources, tools, and 
upcoming challenges for SDU.

Topics of Interest:

The goal of the SDU workshop is to gather insights into recent advances and 
remaining challenges in scientific document understanding. To this end, the 
topics of interest for this workshop include but are not limited to:

- Information extraction and information retrieval for scientific documents
- Question answering and question generation for scholarly documents
- Word sense disambiguation, acronym identification, expansion, and 
definition extraction
- Developing LLMs/generative AI models specific to scientific domains
- Instruction tuning and in-context learning with LLMs for scientific 
documents
- Document summarization, text mining, document topic classification, and 
machine reading comprehension for scientific documents
- Graph analysis applications including knowledge graph construction and 
representation, graph reasoning, and query knowledge graphs
- Multi-modal and multi-lingual scholarly text processing
- Biomedical image processing, scientific image plagiarism detection, and 
data visualization
- Code/Pseudo-code generation from text and image/diagram captioning
- New language understanding resources such as new syntactic/semantic 
parsers, language models, or techniques to encode scholarly text
- Survey or analysis papers on scientific document understanding and new 
tasks and challenges related to each scientific domain
- Factuality, data verification, and anti-science detection
