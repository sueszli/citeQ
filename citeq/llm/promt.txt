Our approach permits an alternative to minimum error-rate training (MERT; Och, 2003);

Use
A citing sentence is classified as "use” when the citing paper uses the method, idea or tool of the cited paper.
We perform the MERT training (Och, 2003) to tune the optimal feature weights on the development set.
